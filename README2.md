### Simple Weather App

## Objective:

Create an easy-to-use weather application that shows current weather information and goes a step further by adding weather icons and dynamic backgrounds based on the user's chosen city.

## Core Features:

Display Weather Information:

Show temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, etc.
User Input for Location:

Let users enter a city name to get weather information for that location.

## Fetch Weather Data:

Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to get weather data based on user input.

## Loading State:

Display a loading indicator while fetching data.

## Error Handling:

Show an error message if weather data cannot be fetched.
Key Concepts to Practice:

## useState:

Manage local state for user input, weather data, loading state, and error messages.

## useEffect:

Trigger the API call when the component loads or when user input changes.

## API Integration:

Make HTTP requests to a weather API.

## Conditional Rendering:

Handle different UI states (loading, error, display data).
Steps to Build:

## Initial Steps:

## Set Up the React App:

Create a new React app using Create React App.

## Basic Layout and Styling:

Develop a simple UI with a search box and sections for displaying weather data.

## State Management:

Use useState to handle user input, weather data, loading state, and errors.

## Fetching Weather Data:

Get a free API key from a weather data provider.
Use useEffect to make API calls on component load and when the city name changes.

## Displaying the Data:

Show weather data in a user-friendly format.
Implement loading indicators and error messages.

## Additional Features:

## Search Functionality:

Allow users to type a city name and get weather information.

## Debouncing:

Optimize API calls by implementing debouncing for the search input.

## Search History:

Keep track of recent searches for quick selection.

## Enhanced Steps:

## Enhanced UI Components:

Create a search input field and display recent searches.
State Management Updates:

Add a new state variable for the search query.
Update weather data state on new searches.
Track search history in a state.

## Implementing Search with Debouncing:

Use useEffect to trigger weather data fetch when the search query changes.
Implement debouncing for a smoother search experience.

## Search History:

Update the search history state with each new search.
Allow users to click on a history item for quick re-search.

## Fetching Weather Data:

Modify the API call to use the search query state for the city name.

## Displaying Search Results:

Show weather data based on the search result.
Update the UI to reflect the current search.

## Error Handling and Validation:

Validate search input to avoid empty queries.
Handle errors during API calls, such as invalid city names.

## Additional Features (Choose One):

Extra 1 (Easy): Weather Icons and Dynamic Backgrounds

## Weather Icons Integration:

Display icons representing weather conditions.

## Dynamic Backgrounds:

Change the app background color based on the current weather condition.
Extra 2 (Hard): Dynamic City Backgrounds

## Choose and Register for an API:

Select an API (Unsplash, Pixabay, Pexels, etc.) and get an API key.

## Integrate API into Your App:

Fetch an image based on the city name.

## Update State with Image URL:

Use useState to store the background image URL.

## Set Background Image:

Dynamically set the background image based on the city.

## Handle API Responses and Errors:

Ensure proper handling of API responses and errors.

## Optimization and Caching:

Optimize performance by caching images or URLs.

## User Interface and Experience:

Enhance the UI to inform users about the city-based background.
Implement smooth transitions for a better user experience.

## Conclusion:

This Weather App provides essential features for weather information, additional functionalities for user convenience, and optional enhancements for a visually appealing experience.
